## Introduction

I've been wanting to create my own (original) profile picture for a long time, but I hadn't
necessarily well-defined ideas or references to create it.

## The profile picture

![My new profile picture](/images/new-profile-picture/pp_axolotl.png)

It's an axolotl which is wearing a bob and drinking soda (or water, I
don't know yet).

I've created it using GIMP, and contrary to what you might think, it is not
complex to use. In my case, I was relying heavily on layers and opacities (for
layers and pen).

The only detail I didn't think about during the creation was the fact that on
some websites, profile pictures are round, so you can't see the fingers on my
github page for example. It's not a big deal anyway.

## Why an axolotl ?

The axolotl is the favorite animal I will probably never have, as it has a cost and requires
a lot of care (I already have a dog for that).

I learnt afterwards that Methylene blue can be used as an anti-stress and
disinfectant, thanks to [Axolotl Passion].
It is a French website created by passionates for passionates.
They give advice on alimentation, aquarium, medications, etc. Each time I go to the
website, I find myself opening multiple tabs and reading the articles for a
long time.

## References I used

I first tried to draw an axolotl from scratch, but it wasn't conclusive. I'm
not used to drawing with a mouse, so I decided to draw over these two
reference images:
