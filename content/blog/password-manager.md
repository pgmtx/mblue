## Introduction

Here I will list ways to store passwords, and which one has more advantages.

## The paper way

Probably the first idea you get in mind, since it is accessible and easy to set up.
You write your passwords using a notebook. Do I need to explain why it is so unsecure ? Fine, I'll do it :
- Anyone at your home could access it, so you have to hide it correctly.
- If someone finds it, they can read your passwords clearly.
- If you lose it, you lose all your passwords.
- If you share the notebook with another person, chances are you won't remember where you left it *at least once*, and it will happen.

If you live alone, then you have the advantage to trust only yourself to remember the location.

## The paper way, but unclear

Same as above, but you write your passwords in a different manner:

1. Find your way to create your password. For example, you replace every r occurrence by %, or every a by @.
2. Keep it in mind, then write the passwords without any symbol.

Example : for `M1st3%B3@st`, you would write `MisterBeast`.

The rules you're using in (1) to create your passwords from a basic expression is called **encryption**.

## Using your browser

Please don't do this. These passwords are saved **in clear text**, so again anyone using your PC can access it, including hackers.

## The password manager

One requirement : you have to remember one and only one password, called the **master password**.

## Choosing a password manager

There isn't a password manager that outperforms the others. It ultimately depends on your needs. Paid solutions exist, but they add features in addition of the password manager. For instance, Dashlane also includes a virtual wallet as well as aVPN.

If you don't mind saving data on cloud, a decent solution would be Bitwarden.
