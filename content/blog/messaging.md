## Introduction

Finding an messaging application to communicate with your family, friends and acquaintances might be difficult.
It depends on your needs, whether you mind stepping out of your comfort zoneâ€¦

Personally, my criterias are the following one:
1. Ideally, open source, because it allows more transparency and quick fixes.
1. Fast, one second to send a message is okay, but not five or above (in the best conditions of course).

## SMS

Simple enough, but you need a flat fee. For some reasons, I can't send MMS when on Wi-Fi only. You can't create groups, and if you communicate with
someone abroad, you may have to pay fees. Clearly not ideal, so I add a third criteria:

3. The application should allow you to communicate with anyone form any country without constraints.

## WhatsApp

Probably the most popular app that respects the third criteria.

Requires your phone number. Has encryption, but the keys are held by Meta Inc., and your messages still transits to their servers. Moreover,
WhatsApp collects a lot of information.

One notable detail, which won't affect everyone : on Android, WhatsApp requires Google Services for notifications. As I disabled it, I sometimes don't
get push notifications, even when allowing the app to run in background.

All of these defaults apply to **Messenger** as well.

## Discord / Third-party clients

Discord [has](https://stallman.org/discord.html) [too](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord) [many](https://usemumble.neocities.org/)
[problems](https://cadence.moe/blog/2020-06-06-why-you-shouldnt-trust-discord). In short, it collects much more data than necessary, can ban your account
for no reason, and add questionable features.

And recently, Discord contradict itself by [planning to add sponsored ads](https://alternativeto.net/news/2024/4/discord-plans-to-introduce-sponsored-ads-for-revenue-contradicting-previous-stance/)
[[archive.is]](https://archive.is/dVmGN).

If you still need to use Discord, prefer using a client that blocks trackers, like [ArmCord](https://armcord.app/) (desktop) and [Aliucord](https://aliucord.com/) (Android).
These clients allow you to install mods as well, and, in theory, don't respect Discord's ToS. In practice, I got no problem with them.

## Signal

The most popular privacy-oriented alternative to WhatsApp. Used it for a year to chat with my friends. Honestly, it works well. The similarities
with WhatsApp allow to reduce the learning curve.

Couldn't use it recently because I deleted the Google Services, and Signal needs them to work, otherwise you can't sign up.

## Session

A fork of Signal. The main difference is that you don't have to enter a phone number or username. Instead, a **unique id** is generated for you, which allows more anonymity.
I was ready to use it, but the biggest issue I met was the slowness of message sending and reception.

## SimpleX Chat

Let's go further : no phone number, no unique id made of random numbers. It only uses temporary ids that are different each time you connect.

Unlike Session, the messages are sent and received instantly. However, I don't get any notification sound on my phone when I receive a message. I don't if it is a bug or a way to protect privacy, but it will be annoying for most people.

I haven't tried calls yet, so I can't tell about their quality.

I use it not only to speak with friends, but also to sync texts and files between my phone and my PCs, which is more ideal than using webapps such as
Pushbullet, Google Drive, etc.

In my opinion, the only considerable downside is the fact that you can't use the same profile on multiple devices, since there is no account system. 
Either you connect your phone profile to your pc, which is temporary, or you create a new profile on your pc, which works very well. Speaking of profiles,
creating one is very quick. So if you invite someone they won't have to setup a whole account with a phone number or anything. Another drawback I found: for some reason you can't download json files that you send or receive.
