## Introduction

Yes

## WhatsApp

Has encryption, but the keys are held by Meta Inc., and your messages still transits to their servers.

## Discord / Third-party clients

Discord [has](https://stallman.org/discord.html) [too](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord) [many](https://usemumble.neocities.org/) [problems](https://cadence.moe/blog/2020-06-06-why-you-shouldnt-trust-discord).

## Signal

Used it for a year to chat with my friends. Honestly, it works well. The similarities with WhatsApp allow a to reduce the learning curve.

Couldn't use it recently because I deleted the Google Services. And Signal needs them to work, otherwise you can't sign up.

## Session

A fork of Signal.
I was ready to use it, but the biggest issue I met was the slowness of message sending and reception.

## SimpleX Chat

Let's go further : no phone number, no unique id made of random numbers. It only uses temporary ids that are different each time you connect.

I also use it to sync texts and files between my phone and my PCs.

In my opinion, the only considerable downside is the fact that you can't use the same profile on multiple devices, since there is no account system. Either you connect your phone profile to your pc, which is temporary, or you create a new profile on your pc, which works very well.

Speaking of profiles, creating one is very quick. So if you invite someone they won't have to setup a whole account with a phone number or anything.

Unlike Session, the messages are sent and received instantly. However, I don't get any notification sound on my phone when I receive a message. I don't if it is a bug or a way to protect privacy, but it will be annoying for most people.

I haven't tried calls yet, so I can't tell about their quality.

Furthermore, the website is very clear and transparent.
