# ⚗️ Welcome to Methylene Blue 🧪

> Methylene Blue is a special blue salt used not only for dye, but also in biology, medicine and aquaculture. 

Hi, I'm Programutox. 

I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, therefore I created this website, to share my creations.
I'm talking about privacy, open source softwares and mathematics.
I might also express my opinions about other subjects, I don't know yet.

Besides, I develop [games](https://programutox.itch.io/), and you can see what I code on [Github](https://github.com/programutox/) and [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/programutox/).
