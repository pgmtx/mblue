  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I will present open source apps that I use on my mobile phone.
My first motivation was that I accidentally removed Google Play store and service using adb.
So I had to find alternatives. I was looking for open source and straightforward applications, so that they are lightweight.</p>
<h2 id="app-stores">App stores</h2>
<p>First, I was using <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a>, but loading updates was slow, and for some apps you had to add external links, which behave
like plugins.</p>
<p>By digging on AlternativeTo, I found <a href="https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Store">NeoStore</a>, which is an F-Droid client with a modern UI and
more features. I heard about <a href="https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/">IzzyDroid</a>, but I haven&rsquo;t used it yet.</p>
<p>Next, I found <a href="https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium">Obtainium</a>, which allows you to install apps from their repository (Github, Gitlab, F-Droid).
Since in general, Github releases are more frequent than F-Droid, your apps will be more up-to-date. However, Obtainium is still in beta, so you might
find some bugs.</p>
<p>Finally, if you&rsquo;d like to install other applications, two words : Aurora Store. It&rsquo;s FOSS and you don&rsquo;t have to connect to your Google account to install applications.
And the timing is perfect, you can install it using Obtainium.</p>
<h3 id="for-xiaomi-users">For Xiaomi users</h3>
<p>If you have a Xiaomi smartphone and you want to use NeoStore and/or Obtainium, you have to <strong>disable MIUI optimizations</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are the steps :</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <code>Settings &gt; About phone</code>, and press the button &ldquo;MIUI version&rdquo; multiple times, until you get the message &ldquo;You are now a developer&rdquo;.</li>
<li>No go to <code>Settings &gt; Additionnal settings &gt; Developer options</code>.</li>
<li>Scroll down, there should be an option &ldquo;Disable MIUI optimizations&rdquo;. If not, in the Auto-fill section, tap multiple times on &ldquo;Reset tp default
values&rdquo;. Then you should find the desired option.</li>
<li>You will get a warning, tick the box, wait 10 seconds and press OK.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="apps-im-using">Apps I&rsquo;m using</h2>
<p>All of them can be installed using Obtainium.</p>
<h3 id="imagesopen-source-appsadawaypng-adaway-imagesopen-source-appsadawaypng"><img src="/images/open-source-apps/adaway.png"> AdAway <img src="/images/open-source-apps/adaway.png"></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AdAway/AdAway">AdAway</a> is a lightweight ad blocker. If your phone is non-rooted, it will use a VPN, else it will rewrite hosts file, which will be more optimized.
The downside is that, as it uses a VPN, you can&rsquo;t use other apps which work the same way, such as <a href="https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard">NetGuard</a> or
<a href="https://riseup.net/en/vpn/android">RiseupVPN</a> (probably the only free VPN that is legit).</p>
<p>Similar apps : <a href="https://github.com/blokadaorg/blokada">Blokada</a>, it lets you choose what kind of ads and trackers you want to block, but slows down
much more your Internet connection.</p>
<h3 id="imagesopen-source-appsamazepng-amaze-file-manager-imagesopen-source-appsamazepng"><img src="/images/open-source-apps/amaze.png"> Amaze File Manager <img src="/images/open-source-apps/amaze.png"></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/TeamAmaze/AmazeFileManager">Amaze File Manager</a> is a well-designed and highly customizable file manager.</p>

<p>Similar App : <a href="https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis">Aegis Authenticator</a> (Android only).</p>
<h3 id="imagesopen-source-appsavespng-aves-imagesopen-source-appsavespng"><img src="/images/open-source-apps/aves.png"> Aves <img src="/images/open-source-apps/aves.png"></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/deckerst/aves">Aves</a> is an image and video gallery.</p>
<p>Before this, I was using Simple Gallery, and was pretty satisfied with it. However, Simple Mobile Tools got bought by a company, which then added
ads.</p>
<h3 id="birday">Birday</h3>
<p>Instead of taking notes of your relatives&rsquo; birthdays, you can write them on <a href="https://github.com/m-i-n-a-r/birday">Birday</a>. It will gives you more
information (age, astrological sign) and notify you when it&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s birthday. You can also set reminders that notify you a few days before.</p>
<h3 id="imagesopen-source-appsbitwardenpng-bitwarden-imagesopen-source-appsbitwardenpng"><img src="/images/open-source-apps/bitwarden.png"> Bitwarden <img src="/images/open-source-apps/bitwarden.png"></h3>

<p>A bookmark manager. To sync bookmarks, you need a nextcloud provider. Mine is <a href="https://disroot.org/fr/services/nextcloud">disroot</a>.
There is also an extension, which updates directly your browser bookmarks.</p>
