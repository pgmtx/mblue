# Methylene Blue (abbreviated mblue)

> My personal website hosted on Neocities.

## Why Hugo

I wanted to focus on writing posts instead of html, so I was looking for a static site generator. I was motivated by [this tutorial](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=FCITNuvBwy0).

## Notes

- If you use a static site generator, use the [Neocities CLI program](https://neocities.org/cli). It will be much simpler than importing your files each time you update your website.

- I tried to host the source code of this project on Codeberg, but the submodule was empty. Hosting it here does not do that. It also means that to clone this project, you have to add the `--recurse-submodules` parameter to `git clone`.
